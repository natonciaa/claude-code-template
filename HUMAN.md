# For the Human

This is the template for an agentic-development project. The agent (Claude Code) does the work; you steer.

## Mental model

Three layers, each owned by a different actor:

1. **Raw sources** (`docs/raw/`) — you drop interviews, articles, transcripts here. **Immutable.** Agents read but never modify.
2. **Wiki** (`docs/wiki/`) — the living spec. **Agents own this.** Code that disagrees with the wiki is the bug. You browse it in Obsidian.
3. **Schema** (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`) — how the agents operate. You and the agent evolve this together.

## Day-to-day workflow

| You want to…                                      | You run…                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Start a new project                               | `/project:init` then `/project:interview` |
| Configure agents/skills for your stack after init | `/project:agent-scout`                    |
| Add a new feature                                 | `/project:interview`                      |
| Move forward on todos                             | `/project:work`                           |
| Get a second model to attack the current diff     | `/project:adversary`                      |
| Audit the project                                 | `/project:review`                         |
| Check the wiki is healthy                         | `/project:wiki-lint`                      |
| Ingest a doc or research a topic                  | `/project:wiki-ingest`                    |
| See where you are                                 | `git status` / `git log --oneline`        |
| Tag before a risky change                         | `git tag checkpoint-<stamp>`              |
| Recover from a bad attempt                        | `git reset --hard <checkpoint-tag>`       |

Open Obsidian on `docs/wiki/` — that's your read-only-ish view of what the agent knows. Following the `[[wiki-links]]` and the graph view shows the structure.

## What the agent does on its own

- **Reads the wiki** before any code change.
- **Plans complex work.** When a todo is tagged `[complex]` or batched (2+ todos), `/project:work` dispatches the `planner` agent (on Opus) to write a stepwise plan before testing. Plans live transiently at `.claude/handoff/<slug>-plan.md` (gitignored scratch).
- **Commits one Behavior case at a time.** Test + implementation + wiki tick, committed and pushed per case — so `git bisect` works, any single case can be reverted, and review diffs stay small.
- **Writes failing tests first** (Red), confirms they fail for the right reason, then implements (Green), then refactors — all in one `developer` agent (which follows the planner's plan when there is one).
- **Gets a second opinion on risky work.** On `[complex]` or batched cycles, `/project:work` points an `adversary` agent (Opus, none of the developer's context) at the diff and tells it to find what's wrong. It writes numbered findings and is forbidden from touching the code. **Findings become todos, not immediate fixes** — they land in `docs/wiki/todos.md` at a priority matching their severity, and get picked up like any other work. The exception: a `critical` or `major` finding **stops and asks you** whether to fix it now or queue it. Nothing above `minor` is ever silently deferred, and nothing is ever fixed without you saying so. If the P0 queue reaches 10 open items, it stops and tells you the queue itself is the problem rather than filing an eleventh. Each answer is recorded in the commit that makes it, so `git log --grep="adversary round"` shows you every past review — what was raised, and how it was answered. Simple one-todo cycles skip this; run `/project:adversary` yourself when you want it anyway.
- **Updates the wiki in the same commit** as the code — entity pages, requirements, log.
- **Asks you when it's stuck.** Two-strike rule: two failed attempts on the same approach → stop and ask. On retry, it overwrites the plan with a fundamentally different approach rather than tweaking.

- **Opens the PR when the feature is done.** Once every Behavior case on the entity page is `[x]`, `/project:work` opens a PR to `develop` on its own and hands it to you. It never merges.

## What it does NOT do without you

- Merge PRs, or push to `develop` / `main` directly.
- Force-push or rewrite published history.
- Decide between two reasonable design alternatives (it presents both with a recommendation and waits).
- Run `/project:review` mid-`/project:work` — the *periodic* audit is never in-loop. (The per-change `adversary` is a different, read-only role and does run there — see above.)
- Let a reviewing agent of either kind edit your code. Both raise findings only.
- Auto-invoke the wiki-maintainer. Wiki health passes (`/project:wiki-lint`) are explicitly triggered by you.

## How to evolve the template

The agent ships with a small set of skills, agents, and commands. As the project grows, add more — the agent uses the `update-toolkit` meta skill (one skill covering all three artifact kinds) to extend its own toolkit. You don't need to know the file formats — tell the agent what behavior you want, and it'll create the right artefact in the right place.

Examples:

- "We need a skill for adding database migrations in this project." → agent creates `.claude/skills/database-migrations/SKILL.md` via `update-toolkit`.
- "We need a repeatable entry point for release prep." → agent adds a `/project:release` command via `update-toolkit`.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Editing `docs/wiki/` by hand.** You can, but it confuses the agent — the wiki is its persistent memory. Prefer asking the agent to make the change.
- **Editing `docs/raw/` after the fact.** Never. Append new sources instead.
- **Skipping `/project:interview`** on a new feature. The Behavior cases are what produce sharp tests; without them, the TDD loop starves.
- **Letting `docs/wiki/wiki-todos.md` pile up.** When it's long, run `/project:wiki-lint`.
