# Agentic Development Template

A Claude Code template for building software with an LLM agent as the developer. Wiki-driven, spec + TDD, progressive disclosure.

## Two ideas

1. **The wiki is the spec.** `docs/wiki/` is the source of truth for what the project does and how it's built. Code that disagrees with the wiki is the bug.
2. **Progressive disclosure beats specialized agents.** A single `developer` agent runs the whole TDD cycle, loading task-specific skills on demand. Skills are short, procedural, project-specific — never abstract explanations.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this-template> my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git    # drop the template's history — /project:init re-inits git for your project
claude
```

Inside Claude Code:

```
/project:init        # detect state, scaffold docs/wiki, base docs
/project:interview   # grill yourself on requirements; populate the wiki
/project:work        # pick the top todo, branch, run TDD (Red → Green → Refactor → wiki)
/project:adversary   # point a read-only second model at the diff; findings only
/project:review      # periodic audit in a fresh worktree
/project:wiki-lint   # periodic wiki health check
```

Open `docs/wiki/` in Obsidian on the side. That's your view of the agent's knowledge.

For a worked walkthrough — `/project:init` → `/project:interview` → `/project:work` end-to-end with explanations — see [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md).

## Philosophy

- **Skills are how-to, not what-is.** No skill explains "what TDD is" — they explain "how this project does TDD."
- **Spec → Test → Code.** Entity Behavior cases → failing tests → minimal implementation.
- **Wiki ships with code.** Code edits and wiki edits happen in the same commit.
- **A second model reads the diff.** Risky cycles get an `adversary` on Opus with none of the author's context, told to find what's wrong. It raises findings; it never fixes them. Every finding gets a written disposition.
- **Human in the loop.** When the agent can't decide from the wiki, it stops and asks — never silently improvises.
- **Dynamic config.** The `update-toolkit` meta skill lets the agent evolve its own agents, skills, and commands as the project grows.
