name: adversary
description: Point a read-only second model at the current change. Dispatches the adversary agent (Opus, fresh context) over the diff, collects numbered findings in a mailbox file, triages each one, and re-reviews once. Diff-scoped and per-change — unlike /project:review, which is periodic and whole-repo.
argument-hint: [base ref or lens — e.g. "develop" | "against main" | "concurrency only"]

# /project:adversary

**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS`

The argument **sets what gets reviewed**, resolved in step 1:

- **A base ref** (`develop`, `against main`, `HEAD~3`) → diff against it (`git diff <ref>...HEAD`) instead of the working tree. This is the "or you were given a base ref" case in the preconditions — with a ref, a clean tree is reviewable rather than a stop condition.
- **A lens** (`concurrency only`, `error handling`) → pass it to the adversary as an emphasis on top of the six-category sweep. It **narrows nothing**: the full sweep still runs, because a sweep the author gets to shrink is one the author gets to steer. Say in the report that a lens was applied.

A lens never reaches the adversary as intent, rationale, or a summary of what the change is meant to do — that would leak exactly the context step 2 exists to withhold. If you cannot phrase it as a category to weight, drop it and say so. Empty argument means the working-tree diff and the standard sweep.

You run one adversarial review of the change in the working directory. Findings only — the adversary never edits. You triage, fix, and re-dispatch once. Follow the `adversarial-review` skill for the mailbox format, sweep order, severity vocabulary, and triage protocol.

## When to use

- A simple todo that `/project:work` did not gate (only `[complex]`/batched cycles are reviewed automatically).
- Any change you are about to call done and did not watch get written.
- Before promoting `develop` to `main`, over the release diff.

Not a substitute for `/project:review` (periodic, whole-repo, drift) or for writing the failing test first.

## Preconditions

- A diff exists: `git status --porcelain` is non-empty, or you were given a base ref.
- On a `feat`/`fix`/`chore` branch, not `develop` or `main` — fixes land on a branch.

Clean tree and no base ref: stop and say there is nothing to review. Do not dispatch.

## Steps

1. **Scope it, and keep it small.** If the argument named a base ref, use `git diff <ref>...HEAD`. Otherwise review the commits for one Behavior case, or a few closely-related ones — `git diff <sha-before-them>...HEAD`. Note the entity slug(s) touched. A whole-branch range is the usual reason a review runs past two rounds; prefer several small reviews to one large one.

2. **Dispatch the `adversary`** with the diff scope, the entity slug(s) and Behavior case IDs, the mailbox path `.claude/handoff/<slug>-findings.md`, the test command from `docs/wiki/commands.md`, and the lens from the argument if there was one. Pass **nothing else** — no plan file, no rationale, no summary of intent. That independence is the whole product.

3. **Read the mailbox and triage** every finding to Filed / Fixed / Rejected-with-reason (behavioral rule 20). **Filed is the default** — a line in `docs/wiki/todos.md` at the priority its severity maps to, not a fix. For every `critical` and `major`, run one `human-checkpoint` with the failure scenarios and your recommendation, and let the human choose fix-now or queue; only an approved finding gets fixed, and then by the normal loop (failing test first; spec first if the finding contradicts the entity page).

4. **Re-dispatch only if a fix landed** — and then over the fix commits only (`git diff <sha-before-fixes>...HEAD`), never the original range: re-reading the whole thing is what makes each round surface new findings instead of converging. If everything was filed or rejected, no code changed and the review is already done. **Two rounds maximum** — findings surviving round two mean the unit was too big, so split it and review the pieces.

5. **Log it.** Append to `docs/wiki/log.md`:

   ```markdown
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] adversary — <slug>

   - Commit reviewed: <sha>
   - Findings: <N> (<C> critical, <M> major, <m> minor)
   - Disposition: <Fi> filed, <Fx> fixed, <R> rejected
   ```

   The counts are an index. The per-finding reasons are in the commits — `git log --grep="adversary round"`.

6. **Commit the dispositions and push.** Each fix is its own commit naming the finding it closes; one commit then closes the round with every finding's disposition in its body (behavioral rule 19, and rule 20's record):

   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix(<slug>): <what changed> — adversary F1"   # approved criticals/majors only
   git add docs/wiki/todos.md docs/wiki/log.md
   git commit -m "docs(<slug>): adversary round 1 — <N> findings, …"   # body: one line per finding
   git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
   ```

   Most rounds have no `fix` commit at all — that is the expected shape, not a failed review. If a round produced neither a fix nor a todo (everything rejected), make the round-closing commit `--allow-empty`: its written rejections are the only thing that has to survive.

7. **Clean up.** Delete `.claude/handoff/<slug>-findings.md` — gitignored scratch, and the dispositions are already in the commits.

8. **Report.** Findings by severity, what you filed and where it sits in the queue, what you fixed under approval, and what you rejected and why. Lead with any `critical`/`major` that was filed rather than fixed. Name any rejection the human might disagree with.

## Failure modes

- **Adversary reports no findings without saying what it checked.** Re-dispatch once demanding the `**Checked:**` line. An unexplained pass is a failed review.
- **Adversary tries to edit, commit, or push.** Stop and report it — the read-only invariant is broken and the round is void.
- **Findings contradict the entity spec.** The spec wins until the human changes it. Rejected — out of scope, with the Behavior case cited; or `/project:interview` if the spec is genuinely wrong.
- **Findings keep coming, round after round.** The scope is too large — each round's fixes add surface the next round reads as new. Stop, split the range into single cases, and review those. Do not raise the round cap.
- **Diff too large to review meaningfully.** The cycle batched too much. Review per entity, one dispatch each.

## What you do NOT do

- **No adversary edits.** Findings only; you make the fixes.
- **No leaking author context into the dispatch.** The Behavior case IDs are the brief.
- **No whole-repo audit.** Out-of-diff problems go in the mailbox's `## Out of scope` list and, if they matter, into `docs/wiki/todos.md` for `/project:review`.
- **No merging, no PR.** `/project:work` owns the PR.
