# /project:wiki-ingest

**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS`

Ingest a file or research topic directly into the wiki. Two modes, selected by what the argument above turns out to be — resolve it first (does that path exist on disk?), then follow the matching section. If the argument is empty, ask the human what to ingest rather than guessing.

- **File mode:** `/project:wiki-ingest path/to/file.pdf` — read a local file and produce a `summaries/` page.
- **Research mode:** `/project:wiki-ingest search for exchange rates APIs` — search the web, produce raw research, then ingest it.

This is **focused ingest only** — no orphan scan, no link audit, no lint pass. For the full health pass, use `/project:wiki-lint`.

## Preconditions

- Working tree clean (or only `docs/` dirty).
- `docs/wiki/summaries/` directory exists.
- For file mode: the target file must exist and be readable.
- For research mode: internet access available.

If dirty outside `docs/`: run `human-checkpoint`.

## Branch first (both modes)

The summary page, the cross-links, and (research mode) the raw research file are all tracked, and `develop`/`main` take no direct commits (`feature-branching`, `git-conventions.md`). Before step 1 of either mode:

```bash
git fetch origin develop
git checkout develop && git merge --ff-only origin/develop
git checkout -b docs/ingest-<slug>
```

No remote yet (`git remote` prints nothing)? Skip the fetch/merge and branch off local `develop`. **Already on a `feat/*` or `fix/*` branch?** Stay there — an ingest that feeds the feature you're mid-cycle on belongs in that branch's history. Only branch when standing on `develop` or `main`; in that case the command ends with a PR to `develop` (`pr-create`, body = the ingest report) and `git checkout develop`.

## Steps — file mode

Triggered when the argument is a path to an existing file (e.g., `/project:wiki-ingest docs/spec.pdf`, `/project:wiki-ingest meeting-notes.md`).

1. **Read the file.** If it's a PDF, read all pages. If it's markdown or plain text, read it fully.

2. **Placement check (dedup).** Compare the source's essence against existing pages — filenames and `aliases` (`grep -r "aliases:" -A3 docs/wiki/`). If an existing summary or concept page already covers this material, **update it** (merge new claims into the right section, extend `sources`, bump `updated`) instead of creating a duplicate. Only then derive a slug from the filename: `specification.pdf` → `specification`. If the slug collides but the concept is genuinely different, append a discriminator (`-2`, `-3`) and record the near-miss in `aliases`.

3. **Write the summary page** at `docs/wiki/summaries/<slug>.md` (frontmatter per the Obsidian standard — flat, no `name`/`description`, wikilinks in properties quoted and solitary; see `wiki-update` skill):

   ```markdown
   ---
   aliases: [<alternative names for this source/topic>]
   type: summary
   domains: [<domain>]
   status: developing
   sources:
     - docs/raw/<path>
   contradicts: []

   # <Title>

   > [!abstract] Essence
   > One or two sentences: what this source is and why it matters to this project.

   ## Summary

   2-3 paragraphs: what this source says, who it's from, why it matters.

   ## Key claims

   - Claim 1 ← `docs/raw/<path>` (every non-trivial claim keeps provenance)
   - Claim 2 ← ...

   ## Boundaries

   - Claims that contradict existing wiki pages (link them with [[wiki-links]] and set `contradicts` on both pages).
   - Unverified or unsourced claims.

   ## Updates to the wiki

   - Which entity/concept/decision pages you updated based on this source.
   ```

   If the source is already in `docs/raw/`, great — use that path. If it's outside (e.g., a PDF the human just dropped in the repo root), note its current location and suggest moving it to `docs/raw/` in the report.

4. **Cross-link.** Grep `docs/wiki/` for terms from the summary. If an entity or concept page overlaps with claims from the source, add a `[[summaries/<slug>]]` reference where relevant in that page's body, and merge material new claims into the section where they belong. If the source contradicts an existing claim, add `"[[summaries/<slug>]]"` / `"[[<page>]]"` to the two pages' `contradicts` properties and note the conflict in both `## Boundaries` sections — unresolved `contradicts` is the reconciliation flag `/project:wiki-lint` picks up. Linking from the pages it informs is what makes the summary reachable — there is no central index.

5. **Append to `docs/wiki/log.md`:**

   ```markdown
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] /project:wiki-ingest file

   - Ingested: <path> → [[summaries/<slug>]]
   - Cross-links added: <list>
   ```

6. **Commit and push** (push immediately — behavioral rule 19):

   ```bash
   git add docs/wiki/
   git commit -m "docs: ingest <filename> → [[summaries/<slug>]]"
   git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
   ```

7. **Report** to the human: slug, summary path, key claims, any contradictions flagged.

## Steps — research mode

Triggered when the argument is a research query (starts with "search for", "research", "find", "look up", etc. — or when the argument is not a path to an existing file).

1. **Dispatch the `researcher` agent** with the research query. The agent will:
   - Search the web
   - Fetch relevant pages
   - Write `docs/raw/research/<slug>.md`

2. **Wait for the researcher to complete.** If the researcher fails (no results, all sources unreachable), report and stop.

3. **Read the raw research** at `docs/raw/research/<slug>.md`.

4. **Write the summary page** at `docs/wiki/summaries/<slug>.md` following the same template as file mode (above). The `sources:` frontmatter points to the raw research file.

5. **Cross-link** against existing wiki pages (same as file mode step 4).

6. **Append to `docs/wiki/log.md`** (same as file mode step 5).

7. **Commit and push** (push immediately — behavioral rule 19):

   ```bash
   git add docs/raw/research/ docs/wiki/
   git commit -m "docs: ingest research <slug> → [[summaries/<slug>]]"
   git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
   ```

8. **Report** to the human: topic, slug, top findings, key recommendations, any contradictions flagged.

## Ambiguous case

If the argument could be either (e.g., `search.md` — it's both a valid file path and looks like a research topic), prefer **file mode**. The human can disambiguate by prefixing with "search for".

## Failure modes

- **File not found / unreadable.** Report the exact error. Don't guess the format.
- **PDF too large.** If a PDF has >20 pages, read it in chunks and synthesize progressively. If it's >100 pages, ask the human which sections matter.
- **Researcher returns nothing.** Report and stop. Don't fabricate a summary from thin air.
- **Slug collision.** First check it isn't the **same concept** under another name (aliases) — if it is, update that page. Genuinely different: append `-2`, warn the human.
- **Contradiction with existing wiki page.** Set `contradicts` on both pages and note it in both `## Boundaries` sections. Don't silently resolve.

## What you do NOT do

- **No lint pass.** This is ingest only. For lint, use `/project:wiki-lint`.
- **No code changes.** This touches `docs/wiki/` and `docs/raw/` only.
- **No raw edits.** The raw source is immutable.
- **No silent contradiction resolution.** Flag both sides; let the human or `/project:interview` decide.
- **No mass rewrites of entity pages.** A cross-link is fine; a full entity-page rewrite to match a new source is `/project:interview` territory.

## Wiki updates

- `docs/wiki/summaries/<slug>.md` (new)
- `docs/wiki/log.md` (one entry appended)
- Possibly: entity/concept pages (cross-link in Related section)
