# TDD Loop

Use this every time you implement code on a `feat/*` or `fix/*` branch. Nothing enforces test-first automatically — keeping the discipline is on you.

## Read first

- `docs/wiki/commands.md` — the canonical test command for this project.
- `docs/wiki/architecture.md` — testing strategy (unit vs integration, fixtures, isolation).
- `docs/wiki/gotchas.md` — known test pitfalls.
- The relevant `docs/wiki/entities/<slug>.md` — its `## Behavior` section is the contract.

## One case at a time

You own the whole cycle — write the test, then implement, then commit. There is no separate tester and no handoff JSON.

Run Red → Green → Refactor → Commit for **one** Behavior case, then start the next. Don't batch: five tests then five implementations then one commit produces a diff that can't be bisected, can't be reverted case-by-case, and is too large for the `adversary` to review without manufacturing new findings every round.

## Red

1. For the Behavior case in hand, write **one** focused test, named after the behavior so it maps back to the case ID.
2. Run the canonical `test command` from `docs/wiki/commands.md`. Confirm the new tests actually fail.
3. Confirm the failure reason matches "missing implementation" — not a typo, import error, or fixture issue. If it's the wrong reason, fix the test and re-run until the failure is genuine.
4. Mark each covered case `[ ]` → `[~]` on the entity page once its test is confirmed failing.

## Green

1. Write the **smallest** code that makes the failing test pass. No future-proofing, no extra helpers, no abstractions for cases the test doesn't cover.
2. Re-run the test command. The previously-failing tests must pass; no previously-passing test may now fail.
3. If you broke another test, you over-reached. Revert, narrow your change, retry.

## Refactor

Only after green. Goal: improve structure without changing behavior.

1. Make one structural change at a time (extract method, rename, collapse duplication).
2. Re-run the test command after each change. Stay green.
3. Stop when the code is "good enough for this entity's current scope." Don't refactor neighboring code.

## Commit

Close each case before starting the next — this is the cadence `docs/wiki/git-conventions.md` specifies, and you own it, not `/project:work`.

1. Tick the case `[~]` → `[x]` on the entity page (see "Wiki update" below).
2. Stage that case's test, its implementation, and the entity-page edit — explicitly by path, never `git add -A`.
3. Commit: `feat(<slug>): <behavior in present tense>`, one case per commit.
4. Push (`git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"`). An unpushed commit dies with the container — behavioral rule 19.
5. Refactor commits are separate (`refactor(<slug>): …`). Never commit half-green code.

Then start the next case at Red.

## When to stop and ask

Use `human-checkpoint` if:

- The test seems to encode wrong behavior. Don't change the test — change the spec first.
- Green requires touching code outside the current entity's scope.
- You hit a design fork (two reasonable implementations) the wiki doesn't pre-decide.

## Wiki update — same change

After green + any refactor:

- Tick the Behavior cases on the entity page from `[~]` to `[x]`. The three states (`[ ]` / `[~]` / `[x]`) and their transitions are defined in the `spec-writing` skill — see its "Behavior case states" section.
- Update the entity page's "Implementation" section with the files now touched.
- If you discovered a project-specific pitfall, follow `gotcha-recording`.
- Follow `wiki-update` for the link/format details.

## Two-strike rule

If your second attempt on the same mechanism fails (broken green, refactor explodes, unsolvable test), stop. Tag the state (`git tag checkpoint-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`), `git reset --hard` to a known-good commit, then re-spec via `/project:interview` or pause with `human-checkpoint`.

## Anti-patterns

- **Modifying tests to make them pass.** Forbidden. Spec → test → code, in that order.
- **Bulk green.** Don't try to make 5 failing tests pass with one change. One test, one change.
- **Batching commits.** One commit at the end of the cycle instead of one per case. It breaks `git bisect`, makes a single case unrevertable, and inflates the review diff until the `adversary` can't converge on it.
- **Refactor before green.** Doesn't compile? Doesn't run? You're not at refactor yet.
- **Skipping the failure-reason check.** A "failing test" that fails on import is not Red — it's a broken test.
