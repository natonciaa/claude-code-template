# Human Checkpoint

Stop and ask when the wiki doesn't have an answer. Don't guess. Don't silently improvise.

## When to stop

| Situation                                                         | Action                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Two failed attempts on the same mechanism                         | Stop. Tag the state (`git tag checkpoint-<stamp>`). Present the two attempts and ask for direction. |
| Test seems to encode wrong behavior                               | Stop. Spec change must come from human; don't change the test.                                      |
| Design fork the wiki doesn't pre-decide                           | Stop. Present both options with tradeoffs and recommendation.                                       |
| Uncommitted changes from a prior session                          | Stop. Ask whether to commit, stash, or discard.                                                     |
| Branch state unclear (off develop, prior PR merged?)              | Stop. Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` and show output.                                 |
| About to delete files, force-push, drop tables, hit a third party | Stop. Confirm scope and authorization.                                                              |
| A skill or wiki page you need doesn't exist                       | Stop. Ask before improvising; offer to create it via `update-toolkit`.                              |
| Test command runs but produces ambiguous output                   | Stop. Show the output, ask what to interpret it as.                                                 |

## When NOT to stop

Measured across three projects on this template: **72–100% of checkpoints were answered by taking the agent's own `(Recommended)` option, unchanged** — 81 of 112 in one, 12 of 12 in another. A checkpoint the human always answers the same way is a notification wearing a question's clothes, and it costs the same attention as a real one. Two tests before you ask:

- **Is there a genuine fork?** If you have a recommendation and the alternative is one you would argue against, that is not a decision — state what you are doing and why, in one line, and do it. Reversibility is what makes this safe: a branch, a commit, and a tick in an entity page are all cheap to undo, so proceed and let the human redirect.
- **Does the schema already answer it?** Asking "should this go through the spec-first workflow?" or "should I write the test first?" is asking permission to skip rules 1 and 2. The answer is in `behavioral.md`; read it instead of asking.

The rows in the table above stay checkpoints regardless — they are the irreversible and genuinely-forked cases, and rule 20's `critical`/`major` gate is deliberately an interruption. What this section removes is the third kind: the confirmation you already know the answer to.

## How to ask

Use this structure — clear, structured, no padding:

```
**Why I'm stopping:** <one line>

**Context:**
- <fact 1>
- <fact 2>

**Options:**
1. <Option A> — <one-line tradeoff>
2. <Option B> — <one-line tradeoff>

**My recommendation:** <which option and one-line why>

**What I need from you:** <pick one of the options OR give a different direction>
```

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool when:

- The choice has 2–4 discrete options.
- Each option can be summarized in 1–2 lines.

Otherwise, post the structured ask in chat text and wait.

## What you do NOT do while waiting

- Don't keep editing files in the background.
- Don't proceed with a "I'll just try this in the meantime" branch.
- Don't bury the ask under further analysis. State it cleanly and stop.

## After the human answers

- Echo back the chosen path in one line so the human can confirm you understood.
- If the decision implies a new rule, file it: add to `.claude/rules/behavioral.md` (discipline issue) or `docs/wiki/gotchas.md` (project-specific failure).
- If the decision implies a new pattern, queue it: append to `docs/wiki/wiki-todos.md` (e.g. `Document <pattern> as a concept`).
- Then resume work.

## Anti-patterns

- **Asking after acting.** "I did X — is that OK?" is not a checkpoint. Stop before acting.
- **Asking what the rules already answer.** A checkpoint is for what the wiki and `behavioral.md` don't decide. Requesting permission to skip a rule is not a checkpoint; it is the rule failing.
- **Checkpointing a foregone conclusion.** If you would argue against every option but your recommendation, say what you're doing and proceed (see *When NOT to stop*).
- **Open-ended questions.** "What should I do?" wastes the human's time. Present options and a recommendation.
- **Wall-of-text context dumps.** Three bullets, then the question.
- **Asking without the wiki-anchor.** Cite the entity / todo / requirement that prompted the ask, so the human can correct the spec if needed.
